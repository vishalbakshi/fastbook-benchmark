This folder contains notebooks (and a corresponding `utils.py` script and Claude-generated FTS keywords) associated with each of the video walkthroughs:

- Document processing
- Full text search
- Scoring retrieval results
- Single vector search
- ColBERT search

This folder also contains my [hand-calculated validation](https://github.com/vishalbakshi/fastbook-benchmark/blob/main/examples/2024-12-13-fastbook-benchmark-results-MANUAL%20VALIDATION.xlsx) of results that I ran using my code in the [2024_12_13_fastbook_benchmark_results.ipynb](https://github.com/vishalbakshi/fastbook-benchmark/blob/main/examples/2024_12_13_fastbook_benchmark_results.ipynb) notebook.
