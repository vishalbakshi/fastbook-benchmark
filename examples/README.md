This folder contains notebooks (and a corresponding `utils.py` script and Claude-generated FTS keywords) associated with each of the video walkthroughs:

- Document processing
- Full text search
- Scoring retrieval results
- Single vector search
- ColBERT search

This folder also contains my hand-calculated validation (in Excel) of results that I ran using my code in the 2024_12_13_fastbook_benchmark_results.ipynb notebook.
